# Universal UI

A library of unstyled UI primitives for React Native and Expo.

## Philosophy

- **Minimal dependencies** - We keep the dependency footprint as small as possible
- **Easy to use** - Simple, intuitive APIs that just work
- **Unstyled by default** - Full control over your component styling

## Roadmap

Styled components with sensible defaults are coming soon. The current focus is on building a solid foundation of accessible, flexible primitives.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @korsolutions/ui
```
